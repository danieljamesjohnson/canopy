## Completed Plans

| Phase | Plan | Summary | Completed |
|-------|------|---------|-----------|
| 01-foundation | 01-01 | All Phase 1 packages installed via pubspec.yaml with hive_ce_generator build.yaml config and clean 11-directory lib scaffold replacing the Flutter counter demo | 2026-02-24 |
| 01-foundation | 01-02 | 7 Hive entity classes (typeIds 0-6) with UUID v4 string IDs, int time storage, and build_runner-generated TypeAdapter .g.dart files; flutter analyze clean | 2026-02-24 |
| 01-foundation | 01-03 | go_router StatefulShellRoute with 4-tab NavigationBar, onboarding redirect via SettingsNotifier.refreshListenable, and 6 stub screens + 4 ChangeNotifier stubs | 2026-02-24 |

## Decisions

| Phase-Plan | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Used hive_ce over Isar | RESEARCH.md confirmed hive_ce is the selected database (OQ-1 resolved at research phase) |
| 01-01 | MaterialApp used in main.dart placeholder (not MaterialApp.router) | go_router intentionally wired in plan 01-04 after all dependencies exist |
| 01-01 | All entity IDs will use UUID v4 strings | Compatible with eventual sync in v2; consistent from the start |
| 01-03 | createRouter(SettingsNotifier) factory function | Prevents GoRouter init before Provider tree exists |
| 01-03 | Onboarding and QuarterlyReview outside StatefulShellRoute shell | No bottom nav shown on those screens |
| 01-02 | Timestamp fields (generatedAt, recordedAt, completedAt) use DateTime; schedulable times use int | Timestamps record "when this happened"; schedulable times are minutes from midnight UTC |
| 01-02 | Enums stored as int index (goalTypeIndex, chunkTypeIndex, eventIndex) | Fragile across renames if stored as string; int index is safe |

---
- [Phase 01-04]: SettingsNotifier constructed before MultiProvider so same instance passed to createRouter and ChangeNotifierProvider.value
- [Phase 01-04]: Migration runner stores schemaVersion as int in SharedPreferences; _migrations list is index-based, additive-only
- [Phase 01-04]: CompletionLog and QuarterlySnapshot repository interfaces have no delete/update — append-only enforced at interface level
